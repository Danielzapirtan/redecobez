Create a photorealistic 3D interior render of a room with the following layout:

Room size: 320 × 310 cm (treat as proportions if scaled).

Furniture objects and positions (top-down coordinates, origin at top-left):
bookcase: positioned at (0, 0), size (120×20); door: positioned at (280, 0), size (40×40); wardrobe: positioned at (0, 20), size (60×90); bed: positioned at (0, 110), size (80×180); window: positioned at (70, 310), size (140×10); plant: positioned at (100, 300), size (80×10); desk: positioned at (260, 220), size (40×70); chair: positioned at (230, 240), size (30×30); nightstand: positioned at (260, 100), size (40×40)

Rendering requirements:
• Use realistic materials, global illumination, soft shadows.
• Furniture should match described positions precisely.
• Camera angle: 35–45° isometric perspective.
• High fidelity textures for walls, floor, and furniture.
• No people. No text. Non-interactive.

Output: A single photorealistic 3D render.
